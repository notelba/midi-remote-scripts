# About
In Ableton Live, MIDI Remote Scripts are Python scripts which control the behaviour of supported MIDI controllers ("Control Surfaces"). It's a way to create fixed mappings and custom behaviour for your hardware. In this repository you'll find decompiled MIDI Remote Scripts, so you can write your own.

There is no official documentation of Live's Python API and little information online. There is some information gathered at https://remotescripts.blogspot.com.
